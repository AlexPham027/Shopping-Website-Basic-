Project Title: Dynamic Online Storefront

Project Description:
In this project, I developed a dynamic online storefront that showcases a catalog of streetwear products. 
The core objective was to create an interactive, user-friendly interface that allows users to browse through 
different categories of clothing and view detailed information about each product.

Technologies Used:

HTML: 
I structured the webpage with HTML5, ensuring a semantic and accessible markup. The page includes a header with the store's name and slogan, 
a navigation menu to switch between product categories, and a table that dynamically populates with products.

CSS:
For styling, I leveraged a minimalistic CSS framework, Sakura, and added custom styles to enhance the user experience. I used CSS to create a 
responsive layout, visually appealing elements like buttons and tables, and interactive cues such as a pointer cursor on hover to indicate clickable items.


JavaScript: 
The interactivity of the site is driven by JavaScript. I implemented an approach that responds to user actions. When the page loads, JavaScript dynamically 
creates buttons for each product category. Upon clicking these buttons, the product listings update without a page refresh. This is achieved by 
manipulating the DOM to reflect the current state of the application, such as the selected category and the list of products displayed.
